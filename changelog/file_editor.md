title: File editor
date: 03/21/2025

I have added a rudimentary file editor to the spaces file browser. The editor supports .html, .css and .js files. Give it a try.

Latest changes:

- Implemented rudimentary file editor
- Revised some of the file upload functionality
- Added the ability to create empty .html, .css and .js files. (Thanks Charlie)
