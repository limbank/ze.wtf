title: RBAC and Spaces
date: 03/14/2025

This is a pretty big update with a lot of changes, so I'll try to keep it as short as possible while I continue to work on new features.

Latest changes:

- Fixed the Changelog page not being viewable by logged out users (thanks Charlie)
- Fixed the link script paging the wrong endpoint (thanks Charlie (again))
- Added user roles and permissions
- Added the file router for user spaces
- Fixed a bunch of broken bits and weird syntax
