date: 03/23/2025

I have been focusing on impoving site-wide security and performance. The site should now be quite a bit zippier.

Latest changes:

- Reduced the number of re-auth calls
- Added dynamic linking for invites
- Fixed the issue with edited files not saving
- Fixed file editor ignoring parent directory when saving (Thanks spaghetti)
