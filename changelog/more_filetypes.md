title: More filetypes
date: 03/19/2025

I have allowed more filetypes to be uploaded on the homepage. Also revamped the invite creation system somewhat so it should now be more fluid.

Latest changes:

- Changed the invite creation interface in the dash
- Allowed video files and archives to be uploaded on the homepage
- Added .MOV and fixed the reject case error (Thanks Charlie)
- Fixed the footer missing on the files tab in dashboard
