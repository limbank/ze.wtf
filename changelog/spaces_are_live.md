title: Spaces are live!
date: 03/17/2025
version: 0.0.7

Spaces are finally here. Create a new space and try it out! For now, you can only manually create directories and upload files one by one, but I hope to make batch uploads available soon.

Latest changes:

- Added a new file browser for spaces
- Added the ability to create spaces
- Changed lots of code and organized files better
- Introduced a lot of new permissions
- Fixed an API bug relating to space creation (Thanks Charlie)
